My book (dwulf's manifesto) on Rust, notes, details, and references.

## In Rust we Trust:
*~dwulf*

> I live in code,
> my logic is real.
> my own abode,
> its electrons I steal.

> The code is Rust,
> with a compiler that knows.
> to never trust,
> the sytnax that still grows.

> Complication, 
> is a name of a game.
> that computation,
> will reduce just the same.

> To clarify,
> we code what we trust.
> To simplify,
> we code it in Rust

## Sanity Check
---
Sanity testing is performed to ensure that the code changes that are made are working as properly. 
Sanity testing is a stoppage to check whether testing for the build can proceed or not. 
The focus of the team during sanity testing process is to validate the functionality of the application and not detailed testing.
A sanity test isn't limited in any way to the context of programming or software engineering. 
A sanity test is just a casual term to mean that you're testing/confirming/validating something that should follow very clear and simple logic.
