# RustWerks
My book (dwulf's manifesto) on Rust, notes, details, and references.

## In Rust we Trust:
*~dwulf*

> I live in code,
> my logic is real.
> my own abode,
> its electrons I steal.

> The code is Rust,
> with a compiler that knows.
> to never trust,
> the sytnax that still grows.

> Complication, 
> is a name of a game.
> that computation,
> will reduce just the same.

> To clarify,
> we code what we trust.
> To simplify,
> we code it in Rust
