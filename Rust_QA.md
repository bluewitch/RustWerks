1) Explain Rust?
Rust is blazingly fast systems programming language that prevents segfaults and guarantees thread safety.

2) Rust was Designed by whom
Originally Rust was designed by Graydon Hoare, Now it managed by Rust project developers.



3) When the first version of Rust was released
The first version of Rust was released in the year 2010.




4) Rust syntax is similar to which programming Language
Rust is syntactically similar to C++.



5) List some features of Rust?
Rust Programming Language comes with following features Sets.
zero-cost abstractions
move semantics
guaranteed memory safety
threads without data races
trait-based generics
pattern matching
type inference
minimal runtime
efficient C bindings



6) Who uses Rust?
Google
360dialog
OneSignal
Coursera
Atlassian
Braintree
npm, Inc
Mozilla
Academia.edu
Xero

7) List the Platforms supported by Rust Programming Language
Linux, Mac, and Windows, on the x86 and x86-64 CPU architecture, are some major platforms supported by Rust Programming Language. 



8) List steps to install Rust?
On Linux and macOS simply open the terminal and run following commands
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
Above command will download a script, and start the installation process. If everything was good and no error occurred you will see below success message.
Rust is installed now. Great!
If you are on Windows. Installing Rust is very easy just download and run rustup-init.exe File




9) Do you remember which command is used to uninstall Rust?
$ rustup self uninstall command is used to uninstall Rust programming language.



10) How to get installed the version of Rust?
rustc –version command is used to get installed version of Rust.




11) How to write and run a Rust Program?
Step to create and run a Rust Program
create a file name main.rs and add following code in it.
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
On Linux or macOS to run open terminal run below command

$ rustc main.rs
$ ./main




12) Explain Cargo?
Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager, and Rustaceans use Cargo to manage their Rust projects.Cargo manages three things: building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.



13) What Is That Cargo.lock?
When we run cargo build command it creates a new file called Cargo.lock.Cargo uses the Cargo.lock file to keep track of dependencies in your application.



14) What cargo new command do?
cargo new creates a new project with Cargo. Below is the syntax to create a sample project using Rust Cargo.
 $ cargo new project_name --bin



Oleksii

Strong fundimentals, Linux skills knows Rust core, and has implimented rust specific projects from other languages.  A big plus.

Intergrates CI/CD in his work, very open to converstations and dialog to fix issues, concearn about the work, not about the ego good to work with

Would like to see more on his Substrate, specifically with pallets (what we are working with), we can teach this he is very comunicatable.

Good for a junior role, and can bring to mid level quickly.  Strong fundimentals.


Dusan

He is comming from Ethereum, solidity and has been working on professional projects related to Ethereum for the energy sector.

He is very enthusiastic about going more into Substrate and Rust, but is abit new in the Substrate and Rust department.  Has solid first principles, but does not intergrate CI/CD as much in his internal methdologies. 

Good area knowledge of Blockchain, but I am unclear of his Rust specific focus.
