# ERRATA

"Errata" refers to a list of corrections for errors or omissions made in a book or publication. Typically, errata are provided in the form of a separate sheet of paper that is included with a book or other publication, or they might be compiled and printed in a subsequent edition of the work.

The errors that are corrected in an errata could range from typographical mistakes to factual errors. In the context of software or technical documentation, errata may also address mistakes or oversights in code examples, formulas, or algorithms.
